Goto tests-->rightClick --.newFolder as day01 -->rightClick on day01-->newFile-->variables.

Js 
primitive  and non primitive 
var -->declare and assign the value
  -->does not rely on the type of data to be declared
  var variableName=value
string
boolean
number
undefined


difference between var and let

 --reassignment/redeclaration
 --scope of the variable
 --hoisting

var 
  -->allowed to redeclare and reassign
  -->scope of the variable -->function scope
  --> hoisting-->undefined 

let 
  -->not allowed to redeclare(duplicate declaration)
  -->allowed to reassign
  -->scope is block level /function level
  -->hoisting -->cannot access the variable before initialization

 usage -->testData

const -->declare the value as constant 
      -->cannot change the value
      -->cannot  redeclare/reassign
      
usage -->browserSession id
