# Playwright Architecture

Playwright is a node library that provides a high-level API to control web browsers. It facilitates real-time interaction and automation by communicating with browser instances through WebSocket connections and the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP).

## Internal Working with WebSockets

Playwright establishes a WebSocket connection to browser instances, enabling it to send commands and receive events in a non-blocking, asynchronous manner. This WebSocket-based communication is crucial for efficiently automating browser operations such as navigation, input, and rendering.

## Integration with Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)
The Chrome DevTools Protocol offers a comprehensive set of tools for nearly every aspect of web development and browser control, from DOM inspection to network management and performance profiling. Playwright utilizes CDP to offer fine-grained control over Chrome and Chromium-based browsers, enabling advanced automation capabilities that extend beyond basic page interactions. Through CDP, Playwright can perform actions like capturing screenshots, intercepting network requests, and manipulating browser sessions in ways that are not possible through traditional web automation tools.
