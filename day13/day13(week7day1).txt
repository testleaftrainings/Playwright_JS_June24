12.30PM to 1.00PM  -Basic POM Structure


OOPs -->Object oriented Programming 
    
    Why? 
     -Modularity 
     -Resusability(avoid duplication)
     -Easy maintenance

     Mobile -->properties/features ->functionality-->define object

     Login Page -->properties ->info like credentials 
                -->function-->action on the element
     
Login button /Sign up/ forget password

Loginpage -->homePage-->module
signup-->form filling-->loginpage-->hmpage
forgot password -->mail -->login page-->hmpage

class  -->properties /methods
object
constructor

class->prototype /desighn for the defining the similar object
object->fb login, salesforce, leaftaps
constructor-->method to initialize objects

AccessModifier: visibility of the property/method for other classes
 seen by anyone in the media-->public
 only to me  -->private 
 friends /friends of friends-->protected  -->you extend the access
 
private properties -->getter and setter  -->encapsulation concept

get --> give access to read the variable
set--> give access to change the definition


 //property
 readonly  -->keyword -->final
 static  ->keyword that helps to share the single reference/memory to all the classes 

protected accesses when the classes are connected
 ->accessed by the child class methods
parent class and child class config
inheritance -->acquiring the property of parent 
   -->is a relation between the classes
