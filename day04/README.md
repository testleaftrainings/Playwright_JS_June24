## Agenda: Dig deeper into Playwright

# Understanding Browser, Context, and Page

In Playwright, automation is structured around three key objects: Browser, Context, and Pages, each serving distinct roles in the automation workflow.

## Browser

Represents an instance of a web browser. Playwright can control multiple Browser instances simultaneously, with each operating in its isolated environment.

## Context
A Browser Context simulates an incognito session, allowing for parallel tests in a single Browser instance without shared cookies, localStorage, or session data.

## Page

A Page object represents a single browser tab or window, serving as the primary interface for web content interaction, including navigation and element manipulation.
